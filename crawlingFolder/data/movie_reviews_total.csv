익스트랙션,Nobnob,3.5,NETFLIXでしか観られないのが勿体ないくらい、見応えのある映画だった。特にアクションとカーチェイスが凄く、ガンファイトはJohn wickばりのスピード感で、ベタな100発100中だがキレの良さで全てを良い方向に魅せている。また、流れるように自然に、時に有り得ない様な位置へ移動するカメラワークで繰り広げられるカーアクションは圧巻で、ここはぜひ意識して見て欲しいと思った。ストーリーはそれほど深くないが、主要な人物描写がわかり易く簡潔で、すんなりと感情移入出来た。悲しい過去を持つ強い男が戦う、シリアスなドンパチアクションが観たいな、という時にオススメします。
익스트랙션,Frank,2.5,"Was decent but the story felt very flat I found the film to be very generic. Big-name actors in this movie but it didn’t feel as though they’re acting potential was being stretched at all. Overall, I really disappointing but it was barely entertaining."

익스트랙션,탈악파워전사,4.5,"액션영화 좋아하지 않는다. 그러나 이 영화는 예외다. 스토리가 빈약하지만 액션 퀄리티가 미쳤다. 액션영화를 안좋아하는 이유가 보고나면 기억에 남는 스토리가 없기 때문인데, 이렇게 액션이 오져버리면 스토리 빈약해도 너무 좋다^^ 추천"

존 윅,Andreas Sørensen,3.5,"The genius of John Wick is how it takes a simple premise and then just throw a lot of action scenes at you. Action scenes does have a tendancy of bring repetative though, and lacks creativity. This is made up for though by the great build up and Keanu Reeves doing some career best work."
존 윅,leeconomist,3.5,내용은 없지만 솔직한 액션이 주는 쾌감.

존 윅,Katy K,4.5,"I’ve so iffy about wanting to watch this series for the past 6 years, today I took a chance and watched it. I’m so glad I did, the movie I’d so good, it has just the right amount of laughter mixed in with the action and drama, that it made for a good movie."

존 윅,Ellioat,4.0,"Although the plot to this movie is very generic and played out, Keanu Reaves still strived to flesh out his character and lead the movie to the success that it earned. With a few unique twists, the story is able to remain interesting and fun throughout."

존 윅 - 리로드,Andreas Sørensen,3.5,"It is just more of John Wick. If you liked the first one you will probably like this one as well. The biggest change is probably the story. It is richer on lore and way more complex than the first one, which to some might detract from the action, but to me, I just found the world of these assassins fascinating. I do have the same issue with this as the first one, that the action becomes kind of stale and lack creativity, but still a good film."

존 윅 - 리로드,justJessagain,3.5,Director Chad Stahelskin provided Keanu Reeves with a successful sequel as a his character of the retired super-assassin John Wick who only wants to resume a calm civilian life but of course this is cut short by the Italian gangsters. The movie is a fun and ruthless action. The cinematics and plot are an absolute adrenaline rush!
존 윅 - 리로드,Ellioat,4.5,The second installment of the John Wick series picks up in the same manner as the first with John Wick being forced to come out of retirement in order to protect himself and the peaceful life that he wishes to have. An amazing sequel that lives up to the hype.
존 윅 - 리로드,정용한,4.0,결말을 향해 시원하게 달려간다.
존 윅 - 리로드,조영호,3.5,군더더기 없이 깔끔한 액션 하나하나를 응시하게 만든다.
존 윅 - 리로드,달님,3.0,이 영화 액션씬이 호평받는 이유를 모르겠다. 카메라워크나 편집 칭찬 하기 이전에 이미 배우들은 뻣뻣했고 액션의 합이 병신같았다.
