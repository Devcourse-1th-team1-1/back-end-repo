더 울프 오브 월 스트리트,cassie,2.5,"This movie is extremely long. There are a lot strippers, drugs, and swearing so you need to have some thick skin to get through this movie. I feel like it could have ended at 2 hours but just dragged on an additional hour. Basically the movie is about a man who gets his dream job but then watches the same dream rip his life apart."

더 울프 오브 월 스트리트,Jinmade_movie,2.0,"This movie left many great lines and does a good job showing how a person can change.Leo’s acting is so awesome. No question about it.But I had a hard time finishing this movie, probably because the movie lost its fun points that were a lot of in the beginning."
더 울프 오브 월 스트리트,Stephanie Aguilar,3.5,Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job as playing a business mogul and literally becoming rich by fraud. Would recommend to friends. This is something that can happen to people if they’re not careful who they do business with and the characters did a great job at scamming people haha. Good movie.This may contain spoiler!! View
더 울프 오브 월 스트리트,Ellioat,4.0,"Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job of depicting a young Wall Street stock broker who is hungry for money and success. If you are a fan of raunchy comedy and an interesting story, this is a great film to watch."

더 울프 오브 월 스트리트,JK,3.0,"For me who is Japanese, do people usually use drugs like in this movie? Totally different world! I can’t say a word! I guess even though I can get tons of money I have to know it’s not worth without family or friends."

더 울프 오브 월 스트리트,Seana,3.5,Wolf and Wall Street is hilarious and I predictable. The characters are so complex and we get to see the rise and fall of business moguls that show us our history. Leonardo di capriondoes as expected and acts perfectly
더 울프 오브 월 스트리트,fchen31,4.0,Who doesn’t love a Leonardo Decaprio Movie? He’s such an amazing actor and does an amazing job at a entry level broker who ends up defrauding millionaires. I would recommend this movie!

셔터 아일랜드,laurensophie,4.5,"I was recommended this film by one of my friends who was incredulous that I had never watched it.  It is absolutely amazing, and psychologically challenging, so you've got to watch the film once through then I'd recommend watching it through another time to make up your mind.  The premise is that Leonardo di Caprio's character arrives on an island that people never seem to leave and discovers that the place has horrible secrets and he's worried that he'll also never leave.  However, he then starts to question his own sanity.  I think the film is so clever, and if you're looking for a very interesting and challenging film to watch, it is truly amazing and I really can't recommend it enough."

셔터 아일랜드,양희수,4.0,"처음엔 이해가 가지 않았고, 반전의 반전이라 그런걸까 싶었다.허나 테디는 허구의 인물이였다는 것이다. 테디가 끝까지 정신을 못차리고 다시 돌아갈 거라고 생각했으나 마지막 대사를 보고 아니구나를 느꼈다.분위기가 무섭기도 했고, 음산함도 느꼈다."

셔터 아일랜드,mimi,4.0,途中で謎が解けちゃいました。こういう系は結構見てきたので、もう騙されないっていうか…。まぁ、確かにいろいろなヒントが映像からにじみ出てますよねw『誰が犯人か』っていう言葉に釣られてると謎は解けない気がしますね～。あ、でも私はその言葉からコイツがあやしいな…。いや、というかなんかこれおかしくね？…的に導きましたけど。最後の最後は、あぁ…ループなんですね。と少し悲しい気持ちになりましたけどあの終わり方が自然に受け止められました。結構後から来ます。心にズシンとくるアレが。レオの演技がめっさ大好きです！！！★★★★☆　４点　公式サイトを読むとヒントが得られるぞ♪
셔터 아일랜드,KANAぶん,4.0,見ていて混乱混乱、、結末見ても『え？どういうこと？』ってなってネタバレ解説を見て、『あ、そういうことか』ともう一度見直して更に納得した。こういう考えさせられて2度見て理解できるような映画、私は好きです。

셔터 아일랜드,kekeli,4.0,I really loved this movie because it had a plotwist at the end which is quite rear in movies now a days .i like how we think the movie based of this psychiatric ward but in fact it based of the lead man the entire time .its a very thought out and planned movie .
셔터 아일랜드,정수환,3.5,반전 개꿀
셔터 아일랜드,justJessagain,4.5,"Director Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island has received a variety of views and comments, however, I think the movie is superbly suspenseful, echoing notions of Alfred Hitchcock! Actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Mark Ruffalo really complimented each other's acting styles; one being intense and dramatic and other being calming and smooth. The juxtaposition of both characters added to the creative tension that twists and turns around the darkness of the movie. This is a movie you need to watch carefully and appreciate - I found the psychological element similar to Inception."
셔터 아일랜드,taylorhenne,4.5,A highly underrated movie that people unfairly judged. The trailer for these films gave way too much by preparing the audience for a huge twist! Thankfully I tend to not watch trailers in their entirety because I like going into a film not knowing much and for this one I made sure to avoid trailers at all costs. I was completely shook by the end of the film. The storyline was amazing. The history of the story. The way we see from Leonardo’s perspective and how we begin to realize that perspective is a very subjective thing. A must-watch for any cinephile.
